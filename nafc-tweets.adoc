We are still strongly considering playing in @NISALeague and in the Open Cup. The major reason we have not made a final decision is that the league has failed to provide us with financial statements. We cannot commit to play in a league that we do not know the financial status of https://t.co/SEtAMO9q81

1/26/2022 20:49
Completely inaccurate. We were not consulted by the league prior to this being announced and we are appalled with Commissioner Prutch‚Äôs behavior. We are calling for the resignation of Commissioner Prutch immediately.

1/26/2022 20:49
New Amsterdam FC will be playing in @NISALeague this season. We sent in our @opencup registration to @ussoccer before the December deadline along with the check for our Open Cup performance bond and registration. NISA‚Äôs announcement that we are not playing in the Open Cup is

1/26/2022 20:57
@MichaelB_96 Yes just messaged you

1/26/2022 23:28
@aghease Games will primarily be at Galeic Park this year! Finally!

1/26/2022 23:28
@aghease Club trains in Tribecca at pier 40 as well

1/27/2022 4:58
@jdhartman24 @NISALeague @opencup @ussoccer At the time we said we were considering playing we were still considering it. At the time we said we were playing (24 hours later) we made a final decision. Hope this makes sense.

1/27/2022 5:01
@jdhartman24 @NISALeague @opencup @ussoccer Pretty tough to agree to play in a pro league that hasn‚Äôt provided financial statements to us or a budget.

1/27/2022 5:14
@PaulLapointe98 @NISALeague @opencup @MichaelB_96 @KnightsWhoNISA @FirstTeamPod @ussoccer USSF needs to force NISA to provide financial statements in a more timely fashion to its clubs that are spending millions of dollars to field teams

1/27/2022 5:16
@FlowerCityUnion At least 50 if Commissioner Prutch keeps up the shannanigans of not providing our club with financial statements or a budget for this upcoming season!

1/27/2022 5:19
@NISALeague Interesting post ü§®

1/27/2022 5:21
@tsuliman @NISALeague Curious how a team that didn‚Äôt exist last year qualifies for a cup, but our team that has played for 3 seasons, sent in its US open cup check in December, and is planning to play this upcoming season doesn‚Äôt get announced as a team that‚Äôs playing in the cup.

1/27/2022 6:09
@DuchessTacoCOT @taco_x86 We sleep quite well! We have dozens of angel investors who are investors in our club and are very thankful to our sponsors for supporting our mission of having a social impact through sports including our new youth academy that had over 1K players register for a tryout.

1/27/2022 6:10
@DuchessTacoCOT @taco_x86 Many professional sports teams are sponsored by or have partnerships with healthcare companies! Red Bulls - Horizon BCBS, nycfc new york presbyterian, and many other examples.

1/27/2022 6:52
@mojodean @taco_x86 @DuchessTacoCOT We believe NISA will succeed under the right leadership. If it fails, I‚Äôm sure you can guess at what the other options are to play soccer in the US. Our investor group is also in the process of acquiring a club in Europe.

1/27/2022 7:10
@eastsidekate @phat7deuce We were really looking forward to that local rivalry.

1/27/2022 7:13
@AndyKingSoCal @phat7deuce John Prutch is often criticized by NISA team owners for being a liar. He needs to resign. You can't have a a commissioner in charge who consistently lies to owners and acts in his own self-interest of himself and his children who work for the league. #prutchneedstoresign

1/27/2022 7:18
John Prutch is trying to push NAFC and CHAC out of the league despite being two strong brands in major markets that finished 4th and 5th last season. Only in America would one man's personal agenda determine a team's league status rather than pro/rel like in Europe.

1/27/2022 7:35
He is scared that the other team owners might agree with us that we might need a new leadership team and a new commissioner at NISA. He is trying to push us out in an attempt to keep himself, his son, and his daughter employed by NISA.

1/27/2022 9:07
@ProtagonistUSA @KnightsWhoNISA ask John Prutch about his fraudulent representation from October to ‚Äúinvest $1 million into Chicago House within 60 days‚Äù from either the league or Football Investments (which he and Friedland control) which he never followed through with.

1/27/2022 12:20
Someone please ask me about when the LA Force owner changed venues at the last minute and made us play at a facility without locker rooms that didn‚Äôt meet PLS. League didn‚Äôt issue a fine. Lights went off in 2nd half and LA awarded win. Ask yourself - why didn‚Äôt LA get fined? üßê

1/27/2022 14:24
@RedTheWhiteBoy You might want to ask NISA who owns the league and see what they say.

1/27/2022 14:45
@NISALeague has provided funding to teams in the past during the pandemic which is wonderful! Do you think the commissioner would try to fund expansion teams A and B instead of founding teams C and D just because C and D think he and his family could be doing a better job? I do

1/27/2022 14:49
@NISALeague should do a $5 million RegCF campaign from fans on We Funder. When we suggested this to commissioner Prutch he refused and said he didn‚Äôt want the public to see NISA‚Äôs financials. We think fans should own part of the league and have a vote.

1/27/2022 14:49
@Wefunder

1/27/2022 14:59
@phat7deuce Obviously if the teams had a vote and the fans did and there was some issue where 5 teams vote one way and 5 vote another way, the fans would be the deciding factor now wouldn‚Äôt they?

1/27/2022 15:02
@cjcoreschi You‚Äôll thank us later when new leadership is put into NISA that grows the league successfully. If only you knew my friend

1/27/2022 17:12
Thank you @ussoccer for your response regarding the @opencup. https://t.co/CgrCOT14I5

1/27/2022 17:36
Great thought - it‚Äôs actually exactly what we have been trying to do!
BUT‚Ä¶.
The commissioner of @NISALeague does not want us to compete in the league fairly 

Not sure the commissioner has considered there are 100s of people affected by his personal vendetta with 1 person‚Ä¶ https://t.co/NNnvypkvzW

1/28/2022 8:19
@NISALeague is now working with us to have New Amsterdam play this season. Hopefully we can move forward with @NISALeague to play some soccer. Looking forward to the season. Thank you @NISALeague üôè‚öΩÔ∏èüèü

1/28/2022 8:47
@ProtagonistUSA @THEDanVaughn @NISALeague One reason among others that we didn‚Äôt pay the remaining small portion of the league dues yet is because they refused to provide the financial statements when we requested them.

1/28/2022 8:56
@skidawgkc22 @ProtagonistUSA Is it ok for the commissioner to lie to a club and blatantly say his group is going to invest $1 million within 60 days into a club and then not follow through? Clubs rely on such statements for financial planning when these types of statements are made.

1/28/2022 9:16
@tsuliman @ProtagonistUSA @NISALeague Agree but that‚Äôs not us. We just launched our academy with over 1,000 players registering to trial and we will have at least five youth teams in EDP this year with 100 players. I think you‚Äôll see us become one of the largest academies in NY. We‚Äôre in it for the long term!

1/28/2022 9:29
@IPlayWithTrucks @NISALeague Ask us anything we‚Äôre an open book. The only way to improve a business or a league is to openly and transparently discuss the issues at hand so we can brainstorm solutions!

1/28/2022 9:30
@IPlayWithTrucks @NISALeague Keep the constructive criticism coming! We actually love it. Rule number 1 is business is listen to your biggest critics. Nothing more valuable than negative feedback!

1/28/2022 9:45
@IPlayWithTrucks @NISALeague Thanks sir

1/28/2022 10:43
@srlwizfan @ProtagonistUSA @NISALeague Amen brother to the first sentence in your post. The league is owned by one team owner that owns around 60-70 percent of the equity. The league was supposed to be equally owned by all of the teams similar to the premier league. But it‚Äôs not.

1/28/2022 10:46
@srlwizfan @ProtagonistUSA @NISALeague Each team owns around 2-3 percent. So basically close to nothing is owned by the teams. Our club has called for the cap table to be reset and the equity equally distributed to all the clubs.

More nonsense from @NISALeague. We told them we were 100% ready to play, pay league dues etc. and now they are imposing rules against NAFC that they are not imposing against other teams. That's not how this works. All NISA teams should be subject to the same rules. @ussoccer

1/28/2022 16:44
Our $250,000 performance bond has been in place all of last season and is in place ready to go for next season. Can‚Äôt speak for other @NISALeague teams, but we are ready to go! See below. https://t.co/RYNccFPyL5

Guess who! Name your guess below! https://t.co/QdWcrjKSue

1/28/2022 18:09
Guess how much money we made in 3 seasons by flying around the country instead of low-cost sustainable travel as you would have in lower division London based football: Multiple choice:

1) +$3M
2) +$2M
3) +$1M
4) break even 
5) -$1M
6) -$2M
7) -$3M

Leave your guess below! https://t.co/Y4cNr6ghUM

1/28/2022 18:11
Our point is Division III football needs to be local and regional. In London clubs at this level travel no more than 3-5 hour bus trips!

1/28/2022 18:12
@cmtake13 @JDallessio @NISALeague @ussoccer There are rumors floating around that our owner played with Messi in 2010 at Red Bulls academy

1/28/2022 18:20
@JDallessio @cmtake13 @NISALeague @ussoccer He actually had two jobs. He was supposed to be working full time for our club since we were paying him $120K/year but he secretly kept his old job at Manhattan Soccer Club. That‚Äôs why we fired him. He wasn‚Äôt giving his full attention to the club.

1/28/2022 18:23
How about a non-profit pro league where all of the clubs have an equal vote?

1/28/2022 18:25
Is it shocking to anyone else that commissioner Prutch hasn‚Äôt given a personal phone call to NAFC or CHAC ownership in weeks? How about a thank you for spending millions developing the league that employs you during a global pandemic? @NISALeague @KnightsWhoNISA

1/28/2022 18:28
One of the other NISA owners offered to provide funding to the league which they could then invest into a club to help them play this season. The chairman of the board said no. How insane is that? He wants less teams playing pro soccer?

1/28/2022 18:29
NAFC and CHAC have still not been provided with league balance sheet, profit and loss, or budget for NISA this season despite NAFC confirming its desire and intention to play this season. @NISALeague

1/28/2022 18:33

NISA pays Bien $600K/year for production which generates no revenue and Bien won‚Äôt even tell them how many people are watching so they can‚Äôt sell any sponsorships! Commissioner Prutch - nice job with the stupidest sports deal in American history. Better to put the games on UTUBE https://t.co/5uKdp8sYJF

1/28/2022 18:54
Does anyone else think it's a conflict of interest that 
@NISALeague's attorney  is also the personal attorney to the LA Force and Bob Friedland the chairman of the board? @NISALeague instead of blowing $600k/yr to Bien, get the teams independent + unbiased legal counsel.

1/28/2022 18:57
I love flying around the country while earning no media revenue - very rational. In league 2 in England the clubs get $1.2M in media revenue and have local low cost travel

1/28/2022 19:01
https://t.co/hZ4Np1dvrg Quote from the article comments ‚ÄúThe LA Force owner is one of the main investors in NISA‚Ä¶ he bends rules all the time and NISA lets him get away with it all the time. He also hired the commissioner of the league‚Ä¶ just saying‚Äù @NISALeague LA owns aprx70%

1/28/2022 19:33
Friedland still could be forced to give @NISALeague $310K of a credit line he promised the league in exchange for the majority of the equity. Shocking that he gets to keep his equity stake without following through immediately on this funding commitment.

@bydaveroberts @cmtake13 can we send you some free gear? dm us your address

1/28/2022 19:49
More NISA teams = more league dues = more teams so the league can keep 8 teams = the Prutch family can keep getting paid from league dues. Say anything bad about the Prutch family / Friedland and boy you are in trouble.

1/28/2022 19:50
If the Prutch family / frieldand had any interest in building a league, then they would not be trying to kick Chicago and New Amsterdam out of the league. Two clubs with amazing brands in major markets that are willing to spend money building lower division football clubs.

1/28/2022 19:55
When the 1st, 4th, and 5th place team are considering leaving the league you know you have a problem. Interesting how after 1st place team left, LA Force (2nd place team) wants to kick out 4th and 5th place team after 1st place left. Maybe they think it will help them win league https://t.co/ioaGStzn4t

1/28/2022 20:06
what would you pay for a documentary on Netflix of @NISALeague - it's so funny that we have thought about making a documentary so many times. I admire all the entrepreneurs/owners in this league except 1. They love the game. Will be biggest revenue source BY FAR! @netflix ?

@DivisionZero4US @NISALeague @netflix nope

1/28/2022 20:58
@taco_x86 Club 9 (John Prutch entity) owns some equity and so does Mission Series (Bob Friedland's entity) that get votes in addition to the teams. If you think that each team has 1 vote, that could not be further from the truth. Friedland also has veto power.

@taco_x86 I don't think he VETOED anything yet, but it doesn't make me feel good that he can. I think the reason they didn't fine him when the lights went off at the game against NAFC is because he is such a big financial backer of the league.

@DivisionZero4US @NISALeague @netflix @ussoccer 1) Demand that John Prutch resign and appoint Ron Patel or Ron Gilmore as commissioner 
2) League settles with NAFC. Right now the issue is that NISA is demanding we do a $1M performance bond (they are not asking any other team to do this) and the requirement is only $250K.

1/28/2022 21:23
@DivisionZero4US @NISALeague @netflix @ussoccer Then the league needs to use Detroit settlement money to fund Chicago and a bit NAFC. Both NAFC and Chicago play in Open Cup. Use Detroit settlement money to fund two sick clubs instead of paying Prutch family bills.

1/28/2022 21:24
4 Step plan to fix NISA:
1) US Soccer demands Prutch family resign
2) Detroit settlement money funds Chicago House and the founder of the league Peter Wilt
3) NAFC and Chicago play in NISA and 2022 US Open Cup
4) Sue Friesland to get equity back and distribute evenly.

1/28/2022 21:28
@ussoccer needs to protect whistleblowers like us who want things to be transparent for the benefit of the game. WAKE UP @ussoccer - multiple NISA teams NISA announced playing in the Open Cup have told me they are undecided if they are even playing NISA. Stop lying John - resign. https://t.co/OtVvMuo6ml

1/28/2022 21:29
@taco_x86 Frieldland and Prutch did do something. Their owner George is actually a very nice man. He did reimburse Cal United for their expenses. George is one of my favorite owners and a very nice human being. His family is also very nice.

1/28/2022 21:30
@taco_x86 The issue is that the league tried to fine George and make the stars put $100K in Escrow. It's a double standard that they hurt George, but then they did not fine the LA Force when they played at a facility in a public park and couldn't leave the lights on. Double standard!

1/28/2022 21:32

@nolanater @nisa Dude they are clowns. I could run the league in my sleep compared to these clowns. One of the biggest team owners (I can't say who) said that everyone in the international soccer community thinks the Prutch family are clowns. And that's a direct quote.

1/28/2022 22:30
Listen to how sad this is. When I email all the other team owners Mr. Prutch does not like it. He really doesn't understand that in the age of the internet it is about information sharing and transparency. Oh no please don't send another email to your fellow shareholders! https://t.co/6ls3LEebjo

1/28/2022 22:32
I swear I will liberate lower division soccer for the fans and make the league a success. Not with Mr. Prutch in charge. LFG! https://t.co/t5kg0VJWvz

1/28/2022 22:35
@NYCosmos  we love ya, but can you please just launch a crowdfunding campaign and let your fans invest so they can see the team they love play? It's called We Funder -  get with the program so we can get the NY Darby going again. The people love it. 5K tickets for sure.

1/28/2022 22:37
@NISALeague let me know when you are ready for Mr. Wilt to fix the league. He is waiting and ready. John get the fuck out, thanks. Founders know best.

Stumptown got funding in the past around $800K I believe. Yet the founder of the league wilt asks for a fraction of this for Chicago and Prutch and friedland try to push NAFC and CHAC out of the league and push to deny funding request. Founders deserve more respect.

@honestlyboxey $1M, $400k upfront and $150K a year thereafter. John Prutch and friedland negotiated it with his attorneys without anyone else. They presented it And made us vote on it on same board call. Bad deal for NISA IMO. Rammed it down our throats. No time to think about it IMO.

1/29/2022 1:43
@honestlyboxey They should have presented the legal analysis 48 hours in advance of a board call and then given us some time to review instead of making us vote instantly

1/29/2022 1:44
Will be shocked if NISA has 8 teams. Many of the teams Nisa claims are playing are not sure. Guess they need new Amsterdam and chicago after all. Prutch will come begging soon https://t.co/F9z9i3PpFJ

1/29/2022 1:47
NISA settlement with Detroit is bad deal for NISA. My guess is Detroit made a ton of fraud claims against Prutch. Prutch won‚Äôt tell me what the claims are that Detroit had against the league and him. My guess is that‚Äôs why NISA took $1M instead of $2.5M.

@Nic_Freiri My man this is truly funny

1/29/2022 4:04
@RaffaeleLafayet @THEChrisKessell Each club has 2-3 percent equity. League dues this year $100K. $250k to join NISA. Many clubs do not pay league dues all at once but pay overtime or late. The league does have debt. Yes the league has been late with paying vendors and refs. I want the league to finance CHAC

1) lost their mind

3) their level of optimistic thinking will ultimately result in their financial downfall 
4)enjoys chaos

1/29/2022 4:54
@WhiskeyIsFine Yes sir it‚Äôs being paid over next 2-3 weeks. Apologies for delay. It‚Äôs rough to play in a league with an unsustainable business model that has no media revenue and cross country travel. By the way the league hasn‚Äôt paid it‚Äôs stadium bill to Chattanooga either

1/30/2022 11:03
@RedTheWhiteBoy Well the PTO applies to join NISA and makes a presentation to convince the board to include them in the league, raised the capital to launch the team, meets with US Soccer, hires the staff and so forth

1/30/2022 11:04
@RedTheWhiteBoy Laurence is the primary team owner

1/30/2022 11:06
@NISALeague was an extensive interview process done to see if Josh and Sam Prutch are the best people for the job? If not, is there a set of objectives we laid out for them and can you share that with us? Did they accomplish said objectives? Same for John?

1/30/2022 11:16
@AtlGorillaTalk @NISALeague Because they know every word they say will be used against them in litigation and their leadership is poor. A real leader would call me and try and settle not ignore me for 3 weeks. John doesn‚Äôt want me in the league because he thinks I‚Äôll convince the other teams to fire him

1/30/2022 14:50

@taco_x86 He is gonna play in a league by himself soon , can‚Äôt have a league without the teams. But hey he is familiar with playing in a public park

1/30/2022 17:09
@taco_x86 Many teams want us to play. I doubt they even have 8 teams without us

1/30/2022 17:09
@mojodean @taco_x86 Many of the teams are on our side and want us to play such as Chattanooga, Michigan , etc

1/30/2022 17:15
@NISALeague John prutch is a pathological liar that needs to be fired immediately. He said ‚ÄúThe league / football investments will be investing $1 million into chicago within 60 days.‚Äù Lying piece of shit

1/30/2022 17:16
@ramincol @THEDanVaughn @NISALeague @ChicagoHouse_AC The commissioner promised to invest $1m into chicago and lied about it

1/30/2022 17:22
Russia and Ukraine are on the brink of war but still having diplomatic and open line of communication to settle. @NISALeague commissioner John Prutch can‚Äôt call me about soccer to have a meaningful settlement discussion. Pathetic.

@NISALeague minimum amount our clubs sue you for is $10 million if we aren‚Äôt included in the schedule.

1/30/2022 17:38
@NISALeague -&gt; @DetroitCityFC gone. @oaklandrootssc gone. @TheMiamiFC gone. Why - because the commissioner lies. Imagine new Amsterdam or chicago don‚Äôt play this season? You think we are going to keep our mouth shut? Good luck adding new teams without our support

1/30/2022 17:40
@NISALeague I was having a conversation with one of the expansion clubs who also felt friedland and prutch lie regularly about when and how much their entity ‚Äúfootball investments‚Äù will be investing.

1/30/2022 17:40
@NISALeague I‚Äôm not going to say who but one of the bigger @NISALeague clubs wants friedland and prutch out. Not to mention many others

1/30/2022 17:49
@THEDanVaughn @OldBaeBrigade It‚Äôs a business matter

1/30/2022 17:58
@LeoGlickman1 @phat7deuce @THEDanVaughn @NISALeague @ChicagoHouse_AC Yup there is a plan

1/30/2022 18:00
@THEDanVaughn You sure about that statement? How much do I owe the coaches? BUONA is owed nothing and a final payment to CJ was processed this weekend

1/30/2022 18:01
@THEDanVaughn Maybe realize this was the first season with fans allowed to attend during a pandemic and the revenue projections didn‚Äôt go as we thought. We could have just not even tried to play during a pandemic ‚Ä¶ This happens all the time in business and it‚Äôs about course correcting

@NISALeague said we could play this Spring if we paid our remaining league dues from last season. We didn‚Äôt pay the last $17.5K immediately bc they refused to provide league financials. Many other teams haven‚Äôt paid league dues immediately. See attached payment. https://t.co/Hr9hNnS2KK

@NISALeague, Bob Friedland, and John Prutch appear to be trying to prevent both New Amsterdam and Chicago House from playing this season in NISA and @opencup . I just left a voicemail for @ussoccer integrity hotline reporting these issues asking them to call me back. https://t.co/5P2HUYLU66

1/31/2022 15:51
Soccer nation we need your advice here! Should New Amsterdam and Chicago play in @NISALeague under the poor leadership of John Prutch + try to fire him later or start our own league registered as a non-profit where all teams are truly created equally and have an equal voice?

1/31/2022 15:52
@ChattaGooner @NISALeague @opencup honestly it is so good the grilled chicken with some of that spicy sauce and the watermelon we had it all the time when we lived here!

1/31/2022 15:55

@NISALeague commissioner John Prutch learn about this plz: "A lie is an assertion that is believed to be false, typically used with the purpose of deceiving someone. The practice of communicating lies is called lying. A person who communicates a lie may be termed a liar." https://t.co/AR77Dtwlob

@phat7deuce Plus of course revenue

1/31/2022 16:28
@phat7deuce We are funded through a combination of angel investors + sponsorship from Fruit Street! Maybe you missed this press release that is publicly available: https://t.co/IV82P1dVjc

1/31/2022 16:34
@phat7deuce Fruit Street is a public benefit corporation that delivers virtual classes with dietitians that promote a healthy lifestyle. FS decided to sponsor and help create a club in our community bc sport also promotes a healthy lifestyle amount adults and kids in our youth academy.

I want to say that despite not believing in the commissioner of @NISALeague, our club really believes in the concept of the league and we feel that the other owners of the league are amazing human beings that can help grow the game in this country. Thank you to all of the clubs!

@phat7deuce @vegitalist @taco_x86 Ty for question. FS owns some shares in New Amsterdam and is a debt financing partner and sponsor as well to answer your question. FS is a public benefit corporation that in addition to being a for profit entity has a social impact on the community and youth via soccer.

1/31/2022 20:06
@taco_x86 @phat7deuce @vegitalist We raised at $2.5M pre and have raised around $1m

1/31/2022 20:11
@taco_x86 @phat7deuce @vegitalist No we have dozens of angel investors who invested 25-250k each a lot of doctors

1/31/2022 20:15
@taco_x86 @phat7deuce @vegitalist The doctors and angels invested over $1m

1/31/2022 20:22
@taco_x86 @phat7deuce @vegitalist I said around $1M. And also these documents don‚Äôt get updated in real time that‚Äôs not how a 506c offering works, and it‚Äôs not required to be updated in real time
